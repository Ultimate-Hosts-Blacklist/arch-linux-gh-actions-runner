# GitHub Actions

Provides an Arch Linux package for the GitHub Actions remote runner.

## Motivation

I wanted to use GitHub Actions remote runner to access the GPU on my server. Because of the security risks of having a public runner instance, I put it inside a `systemd-nspawn` container. I wanted a convenient way to install the GitHub Actions runner, so I decided to package it up.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

	git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/github-actions.git

The build and install it:

	cd github-actions
	makepkg -fi

Configure the daemon:

	cd /opt/github-actions
	./config.sh --token ...

Then start it up:

	sudo systemctl enable --now github-actions

## Usage

You might want to combine this with a container. To create a container (including some suggested packages):

	pacstrap -c github-actions base ruby clang pkg-build vim

Then, import it:

	machinectl import-fs github-actions

Configure it:

	$ cat /etc/systemd/nspawn/github-actions.nspawn 
	[Exec]
	Boot=true
	PrivateUsers=no

	[Network]
	Private=no
	VirtualEthernet=no

	[Files]
	TemporaryFileSystem=/tmp
	
	# Expose GPU:
	Bind=/dev/nvidia0
	Bind=/dev/nvidiactl

Boot it:

	sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-nspawn@github-actions.service

### Attaching Shell

	sudo machinectl shell github-actions
